# Bubble Sort Algorithm
  The Java program demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The user is prompted to input the size and values of the array, and the program then performs the sorting operation using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Additionally, the program identifies and displays the number(s) that appear most frequently in the sorted array and their corresponding counts. The code is structured with clear comments to aid in understanding each step of the sorting process and the frequency analysis. This serves as a practical example for learning about sorting algorithms and array manipulation in Java.
